    <!-- The style and design of my webpage is based on a 80/90s fan page. I chose colors that matched the Full House style in the show. Full House is a classic family sitcom about widowed father Danny Tanner, who teams up with his brother-in-law Jesse and best friend Joey to raise his three daughters in San Francisco. Filled with humor, heart, and life lessons, the show celebrates family, love, and growing up together. With that I wanted to incorporate that feeling into my webpage. -->

      <h1>Favorite Character!</h1>
      <p class="double">My favorite character on the show is Michelle Tanner because she is funny, adorable, and always steals the show. Even though she is the youngest, Michelle has some of the most memorable moments and catchphrases, like You got it, dude! She always says what she is thinking, which makes her scenes extra funny.</p>
